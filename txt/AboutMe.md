## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey, I’m Julian – a curious mind with a hands-on background in mechatronics and a passion for software and cloud technologies.  
My interest in programming started early during my vocational training, where I worked with **Siemens S7 PLCs using TIA Portal** and built **Arduino projects in C++** just for fun.

Since then, I’ve deepened my skills at the **42 coding school** and gained practical experience through internships at **MANN+HUMMEL** and **Porsche**, where I worked on IoT prototypes and digital process tools.  
I enjoy building smart solutions and exploring how technology can simplify complex things.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing **guitar** 🎸 or shooting hoops on the **basketball court** 🏀.

**Let’s connect and build something cool!**
