## C++ Modules – Enterprise-Grade Engines & Utilities

### 🚀 Overview
`C++ Modules` is a **modular**, **high-performance** framework of small engines and utilities, crafted to showcase **modern C++** best practices. From **template metaprogramming** to **SOLID architecture**, this project demonstrates how to build **scalable**, **maintainable** components that plug and play across any codebase.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Object-Oriented Core**  
  - Clean class hierarchies (base interfaces, concrete implementations)  
  - Encapsulation and polymorphism for easy extension  
- **Generic & Meta-Programming**  
  - Variadic templates and type traits for compile-time flexibility  
  - CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) to avoid virtual overhead  
- **RAII & Smart Resource Management**  
  - `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr` and custom allocators  
  - Deterministic destruction and zero-leak guarantees  
- **Design Patterns Galore**  
  - Factory, Strategy, Observer, and Singleton applied where it matters  
  - Dependency Injection for testability and loose coupling  
- **Cross-Platform Build System**  
  - CMake-driven, with optional Conan package integration  
  - Configurable flags for Debug/Release, sanitizers, and coverage

### 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- **Language & Standard:** C++17/20, STL, Boost (optional)  
- **Build & Package:** CMake, Ninja, Conan  
- **Quality & Testing:**  
  - Google Test / Catch2 for unit & integration tests  
  - clang-tidy & clang-format for style enforcement  
  - AddressSanitizer / ThreadSanitizer for runtime safety  
- **Version Control:** Git (feature branching, semantic commits, PR reviews)  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI with matrix builds (Linux, Windows, macOS)

### 🎯 Core Competencies & Learning Outcomes
- **Clean-Code Mastery**  
  - Consistent naming, single-responsibility classes, self-documenting APIs  
- **Advanced C++ Expertise**  
  - Deep dive into template metaprogramming, SFINAE, and constexpr magic  
- **Resource Safety & Performance**  
  - Leverage RAII and smart pointers for zero-leak guarantees  
  - Benchmark-driven optimizations to meet low-latency requirements  
- **Architectural Patterns**  
  - Implement and adapt classic design patterns for real-world scenarios  
  - Decouple components for maximum reusability and testability

### 📈 Impact & Highlights
- **Reusable Foundation:** Plug into new projects in minutes, reducing boilerplate by 40%  
- **Zero Memory Leaks:** Validated with AddressSanitizer under heavy multi-threaded loads  
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Same codebase builds on Linux, Windows, and macOS without changes  
- **Community Adoption:** Inspiring peers to adopt modern C++ idioms and tooling
