## IRC Client – Real-Time, Event-Driven Chat Engine

### 🚀 Overview
The **IRC Client** is a **high-performance**, **asynchronous** chat application built from the ground up to demonstrate **event-driven architecture**, **non-blocking I/O**, and **scalable** network programming. Designed for **extensibility**, it supports plugin hooks and protocol compliance for seamless integration into any real-time communication ecosystem.

> “Don’t Panic!” – Hitchhiker’s mantra for when your sockets misbehave.
