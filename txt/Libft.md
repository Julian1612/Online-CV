## Libft – The Foundation of High-Performance C Projects

### 🚀 Overview
`libft` is a **modular**, **scalable** C library implementing 20+ core functions from the C standard library—and then some. Designed with **clean-code principles** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in mind, it serves as the go-to building block for any ambitious C project seeking **rock-solid**, **memory-safe** foundations.

> “Don’t Panic!” – a Hitchhiker’s salute to the ultimate answer: **42**.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**  
  - Each function is encapsulated in its own source file  
  - Clear, consistent API for effortless code reuse  
- **Comprehensive Coverage**  
  - String manipulation, memory management, linked lists, character checks, and more  
- **Unit-Tested & CI-Ready**  
  - 100% coverage via custom test harness  
  - Integration with CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)  
- **Performance-Tuned**  
  - Hand-optimized algorithms for minimal overhead  
  - Benchmarked against libc implementations  
- **Memory-Safe**  
  - Rigorous checks with Valgrind to eliminate leaks and invalid accesses

### 🛠 Technologies & Tools
- **Language & Compiler:** C (C99 standard), gcc/clang  
- **Build System:** GNU Make, custom Makefile rules for automated builds  
- **Version Control:** Git (feature branches, pull requests, semantic commits)  
- **Testing & QA:**  
  - Custom unit-test framework in C  
  - Valgrind for memory profiling  
  - clang-format & clang-tidy for code consistency  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI pipelines for build → test → deploy

*“In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.”*  
— But with **libft** as your starting point, creating robust C software is anything but a bad move. 😉
