## Minishell – The Next-Gen Unix Shell Simulation

### 🚀 Overview
`Minishell` is a **cutting-edge**, **modular** command-line interpreter built from scratch in C. It delivers a **real-time**, **resilient** shell experience—supporting parsing, piping, redirection and signal orchestration—all while maintaining **enterprise-grade robustness**.

> “Don’t Panic!” – even when handling hundreds of concurrent processes, Minishell keeps your workflow smooth.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Advanced Command Parsing**  
  - Lexical analysis & AST-driven parsing for complex command lines  
  - Support for quotes, escapes, environment-variable expansion  
- **Pipeline & Redirection Orchestration**  
  - Multi-stage pipes with precise file-descriptor management  
  - Input/output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `<<`) with error recovery  
- **Built-in Command Suite**  
  - Implemented core built-ins (`cd`, `echo`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `exit`)  
  - Seamless integration with external binaries via `execve`  
- **Robust Signal Handling**  
  - Graceful `SIGINT`/`SIGQUIT` management for foreground & background jobs  
  - Job-control mindset: pause, resume, and terminate processes reliably  
- **Interactive UX Enhancements**  
  - Integration with **readline/libedit** for history, auto-completion, and configurable prompts  
  - Agile-friendly: rapid prototyping and iterative feature delivery
