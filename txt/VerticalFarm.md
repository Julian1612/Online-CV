## Vertical Farm Automation ‚Äì End-to-End IoT-Driven Microgreens Cultivation

### üöÄ Overview
`Vertical Farm Automation` is an **innovative**, **remote-managed** microgreens cultivation system built during an internship to achieve **zero-touch**, **data-driven** horticulture. By uniting **embedded control**, **cloud services**, and **self-healing scheduling**, it automates watering, filtration, and environmental monitoring for **maximum yield** and **resource efficiency**.

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Panic!‚Äù ‚Äì even Trillian would be impressed by this level of automation.
